## COVID-19 Linear Regression Model for Sonoma County
By Paris Osuch

## Abstract
The research in this document can conclude that the population may have a strong correlation with covid cases per 100k people. 

## Introduction and Methods
This paper explores the correlation between a multitude of variables vs. COVID-19 cases per 100k people. The explanatory variables being explored in this model include: population, median household income, median age, and median house value. To determine the correlation between these variables, we were tasked to create a linear regression model. To create these linear regression models I wrote a program in python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and the standard python library. Both Pandas and Matplotlib are powerful data analysis tools that are used to create the tables and plot the data in the tables. To help me with the task of finding the standard deviation, mean, correlation, and plot the best fit line; I developed a number of functions that fit accordingly to the prior tasks at hand. In the stats.py file, you will find the stats functions I created for my analysis. In the main.py file, you will find the plotting and analysis portion of the research. In the beginning of the program, the user is prompted to enter the name of an explanatory variable they would like to find correlated with COVID-19 cases. See image files for models.
